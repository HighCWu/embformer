# 001. Why could we replace linear layers with attention layers?

(Explained by ChatGPT)

### ðŸ“Œ Goal

The core idea is to show that a **linear layer**:

$$
y = xW^\top
$$

can be approximated by an **attention mechanism**, specifically the computation:

$$
y = \text{softmax}(qk^\top / \sqrt{d_k})v
$$

by cleverly constructing `q`, `k`, and `v` to simulate the linear transformation.

---

### ðŸ§© Step-by-Step Breakdown

#### 1. **Original Linear Transformation**

You define:

```python
x = torch.randn(4, 8)
fc_weight = torch.randn(32, 8)
y1 = x @ fc_weight.T
```

This is the standard linear projection:

* `x`: input (shape: `[batch_size=4, in_features=8]`)
* `fc_weight`: weight matrix of the linear layer (shape: `[out_features=32, in_features=8]`)

---

#### 2. **Simulating Linear Output with Attention Components**

We aim to approximate this with an attention computation:

$$
y = \text{attn\_weights} \cdot v
$$

To do that:

* **attn\_weights** are built from the normalized absolute values of `x`:

  ```python
  x_abs = x.abs()
  x_sum = x_abs.sum(dim=-1, keepdim=True)
  attn_weights = (x_abs / x_sum)[:, None]  # shape: (4, 1, 8)
  ```

  These act like attention distributions over sequence elements (dimension-wise in this case).

* **v** is constructed as:

  ```python
  v = fc_weight.T[None] * (x_sum[..., None] * x.sign()[..., None])
  ```

  Essentially, you're scaling and flipping the weights according to `x`'s sign and magnitude, producing a shape of `[4, 8, 32]`.

Then the weighted sum:

```python
_y = (attn_weights @ v)[:, 0]
```

mimics the linear output `y1`, and you verify:

```python
assert torch.allclose(_y, y1)
```

This works because:

* `x`'s sign and magnitude are decomposed to simulate `x @ W^T`.
* The attention weights act as a normalized form of input coefficients.
* The `v` matrix essentially redistributes the learned weights along those coefficients.

#### 3. **Recovering logits**

Now, since we want to reverse-engineer this to look like a real attention mechanism, you reverse the softmax:

```python
logits = torch.log(attn_weights)
```

This gives you the raw attention scores (up to an offset).

Then you add a small random noise term:

```python
logits = logits - torch.randn(1)
```

You confirm:

```python
softmax_result = torch.softmax(logits, dim=-1)
assert torch.allclose(softmax_result, attn_weights)
```

---

#### 4. **Reconstructing q and k**

In attention, the logits are:

$$
\text{logits} = \frac{qk^\top}{\sqrt{d_k}}
$$

So:

$$
s = \text{logits} \cdot \sqrt{d_k} = qk^\top
$$

You randomly generate `k`, then solve for `q` using the inverse:

```python
q = s @ torch.linalg.inv(k.transpose(-2, -1))
```

This gives you valid `q` and `k` such that:

```python
logits_rec = q @ k.transpose(-2, -1) / math.sqrt(d_k)
assert torch.allclose(logits_rec, logits, atol=1e-3)
```

---

#### 5. **Final Attention Output**

Now, using PyTorch's efficient attention API:

```python
y2 = F.scaled_dot_product_attention(q, k, v)[:, 0]
```

You confirm:

```python
assert torch.allclose(y2, y1, atol=1e-3)
```

---

### ðŸŽ¯ Conclusion

Your code demonstrates that **a linear layer** can be **reformulated as an attention layer** where:

* The inputs control the attention weights (`attn_weights`)
* The linear weights act as the value matrix `v`
* `q` and `k` are constructed such that softmax(qkáµ€/âˆšdâ‚–) â‰ˆ `attn_weights`

In other words:

> **A linear layer is a special case of an attention mechanism with fixed `v` and data-derived `attn_weights`.**
